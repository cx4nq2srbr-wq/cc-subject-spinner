CC Lesson Spinner 🎡
A simple, interactive review tool designed for Classical Conversations families. This app helps students review memory work by randomly selecting subjects and weeks, tracking progress, and providing an "app-like" experience on mobile devices.

✨ Features
Randomized Review: Spin the reels to get a random combination of Subject and Week (1–24).

Comprehensive Data: Includes built-in prompts and answers for:

Math, Latin, Science, English, History, Geography, Bible, and Timeline.

Progress Tracking: The Lesson Grid automatically marks lessons as "completed" once they’ve been spun, so you don't repeat the same facts in one session.

Max Week Control: Limit the spinner to only include weeks you have already covered (e.g., if you are on Week 10, set the Max Week to 10).

Offline Ready: Works without an internet connection once "installed" on your device.

No Clutter: Designed with a clean, "Price is Right" style roller interface.

📲 How to "Install" on Your Phone
This is a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning you don't need an App Store.

For iPhone (Safari)

Open the website link in Safari.

Tap the Share button (the square with an arrow pointing up).

Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen."

The CC Spinner icon will now appear on your home screen like a regular app!

For Android (Chrome)

Open the website link in Chrome.

Tap the three dots (⋮) in the top right corner.

Tap "Install app" or "Add to Home Screen."

🛠 How to Use
The Spin: Tap "Spin Lesson" to pick a random topic.

The Answer: Try to recite the memory work, then tap "Show Answer" to verify.

The Grid: Tap "Edit Lesson Grid" to manually mark lessons as "un-done" or to reset your entire progress.

Max Week: Use the + and - buttons in the Grid view to adjust the range of weeks included in the spin.

📝 Technical Details
Storage: Your progress is saved locally on your specific device (using localStorage).

Offline Support: Uses a Service Worker to cache files so the app works during car rides or in areas with poor reception.

Manifest: Includes a manifest.json for a full-screen, standalone experience.

Note: This tool is intended as a supplemental review aid for families enrolled in Classical Conversations.
